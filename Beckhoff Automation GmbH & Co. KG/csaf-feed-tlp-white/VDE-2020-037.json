If the directory does not exist it and further subdirectories are created with permissions which allow every local user to modify the content. The default installation registers TcSysUI.exe for automatic execution upon log in of a user. If a less privileged user has a local account he or she can replace TcSysUI.exe. It will be executed automatically by another user during login. This is also true for users with administrative access. Consequently, a less privileged user can trick a higher privileged user into executing code he or she modified this way. By default Beckhoff\u2019s IPCs are shipped with TwinCAT software installed this way and with just a single local user configured. Thus the vulnerability exists if further less privileged users have been added.",

More precisely, it reads the current permissions of \u201cC:\\Program Files\u201d and copies them to the directory \u201c3.1\\System\u201d underneath the installation path of TwinCAT (default \u201cC:\\TwinCAT\\3.1\\System\u201d).\n\nThe procedure to use that script is as follows:\n\n1. Download the script, unzip it, and copy it to the IPC.\n2. On the IPC log in as administrator and open a PowerShell (Windows-Key + R + \u201cPowerShell\u201d).\n3. At the PowerShell enter the following command to temporarily allow the execution of scripts: set-executionpolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process (The effect of this is limited to the life-time of the current shell window because of \u201c-Scope Process\u201d.)\n4. Then change to the path to where you downloaded the script and execute it: .\\cve-2020-12510.ps1 The expected output is \u201cCopied the permissions from C:\\Program Files to \\3.1\\System\u201d.\n5. Close the PowerShell and log out from the IPC as needed.\nIt is safe to apply the script several times. It is safe to run it during full operation of TwinCAT XAR 3.1. There is no need to reboot the IPC afterwards.\n\nThere is no need to periodically run the script. Future updates of TwinCAT 3.1 will either not touch the permissions which are set by the script or apply more appropriate ones.\n\nTo apply the procedure to a set of IPCs you can prepare a USB stick with the content of the ZIP file \u201ccve-2020- 12510.zip\u201d (see download URL above). Then the procedure for each IPC is:\n\n1. Log in as administrator on the IPC.\n2. Open the USB stick with the File Explorer (formerly known as Windows Explorer).\n3. Double click on the file \u201crun-cve-2020-12510.bat\u201d. (This simply invokes the PowerShell to execute the script already described above.)",
