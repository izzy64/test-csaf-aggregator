Phoenix Contact expects the next version of the Automation Worx Suite to be available prior to the end of 2019, noting the upcoming release of Automation Worx Software Suite will have a more robust validation of arrays regarding dimension and the number of elements allowed during input data conversion. In addition, input data validation will be extended in order to strengthen defenses against manipulated project files. Additional preventative security measures will be enabled for the compiler settings as well.",
