        "text": "SPPA-T3000 Application Server and MS3000 Migration Server are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. Some of the vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. Exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory requires access to either Application- or Automation Highway. Both highways should not be exposed if the environment has been set up according to the recommended system configuration in the SPPA-T3000 security manual.\n\nIn this case Siemens Energy considers the environmental score as CR:L/IR:L/AR:H/MAV:A for vulnerabilities related to the Application Server and CR:L/IR:L/AR:M/MAV:A for vulnerabilities related to the Migration Server.\n\nSiemens Energy provides a service pack to fix vulnerabilities on the Application Server and recommends configurations to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the Migration Server. Detailed information will be available for SPPA-T3000 customers in the Siemens Energy Customer Portal (https://cep.siemens-energy.com/).",

        "text": "Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.\n\nSiemens Energy strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens Energy strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.\n\nAs a general security measure Siemens Energy strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.",
