Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document. \n",

User rights are enabled by default and forced to create a strong password at first use. \r\n\r\nDeactivate the Webserver after use when not needed. \r\n\r\nUse encrypted communication links. \r\n\r\nSetup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to port 80/HTTP and 443/HTTPS. \r\n\r\nUse VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required.  \r\n\r\nThe \u201cCybersecurity Guidelines for EcoStruxure Machine Expert, Modicon and PacDrive Controllers and Associated Equipment\u201d provide product specific chapters \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo ensure you are informed of all updates, including details on affected products and remediation plans, subscribe to Schneider Electric\u2019s security notification service here",
