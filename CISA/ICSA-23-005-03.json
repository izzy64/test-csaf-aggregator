Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. In Lumada APM, this can be triggered by configuring APM to connect to a malicious server for one of the supported integrations. This may cause a crash of the specific APM service implementing the integration (causing a denial of service).CVE-2022-3602 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
