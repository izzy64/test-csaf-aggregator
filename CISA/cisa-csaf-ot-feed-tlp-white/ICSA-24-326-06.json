Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document. \n",

This feature allows the switch to \r\nintelligently forward multicast traffic only to the necessary ports where interested hosts reside. It \r\nprevents unnecessary flooding of multicast traffic across all ports, thereby enhancing network \r\nefficiency and minimizing unnecessary load on network resources.\r\n2. Configure VLAN Interface Settings: \r\no Set up VLAN interface settings on the switch. It's important to have distinct configurations for \r\neach VLAN to ensure proper IGMP operation.\r\n3. Multicast Filtering: \r\no Use IGMP filtering to control the propagation of IGMP traffic through the network. This involves \r\nconfiguring filters on a switch virtual interface (SVI), per-port, or per-port per-VLAN basis. \r\nMulticast filtering helps manage IGMP snooping and controls multicast traffic forwarding \r\neffectively.",
