Such practices include that process control systems are physi-cally protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.\nFor detailed mitigation strategies, customers can approach their Hitachi Energy organization contact. \nIt is highly recommended to deploy the product following the \u201cMicroSCADA cybersecurity deployment guide-line\u201d document.
