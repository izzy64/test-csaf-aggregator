Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

EcoStruxure Power Automation System User Interface https://www.se.com/ng/en/product-range/61456-ecostruxure-power-automation-system-user-interface/#overview (formerly known as EcoSUI) is a local SCADA/HMI,  based on IEC 61850, that helps operators supervise, monitor, and control large and open electrical networks,  with embedded cybersecurity. Formerly EcoStruxure Substation Operation User Interface. EcoStruxure Microgrid Operation Large (EMO-L) https://www.se.com/ca/en/product-range/65897-ecostruxure-microgrid-operation/#overview  is a power management system dedicated to large and  critical Microgrid application.
