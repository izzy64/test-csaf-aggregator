CODESYS Runtime System is utilized in the firmware of ABB ACS880 drives to provide IEC 61131-3 programming capabilities.\n\nThese vulnerabilities could lead to out-of-bound memory access. Successful exploit may result in a denial-of-service condition or arbitrary code execution. Firmware updates are available that mitigate the publicly reported vulnerabilities of the product versions listed as affected in this advisory.",

Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.",

When a workaround reduces functionality, this is identified below as \u201cImpact of workaround\u201d. For situations where firmware update is not feasible, ABB recommends mitigating the threat by setting following parameters:\n\nFor IGBT supply control program devices:\n\nset parameter 196.102 to bit 2 to disable file download (for further bit description, please refer to drive firmware manual )\n\nFor other devices:\n\nset parameter 96.102 to bit 2 to disable file download (for further bit description, please refer to drive firmware manuals)\n\nImpact of workaround:\nThis workaround restricts IEC programs update, but existing IEC programs in Drives can still be used. To update an IEC program, the operator has to unlock the user lock and enable file download in a protected network environment.\nIt is strongly recommended to disable file download. The vulnerabilities are exploitable when file download is enabled.\nWarning! \u2013 The user lock cannot be opened even by ABB if the pass code is lost. \n",
