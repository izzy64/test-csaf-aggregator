This could lead to denial of service or tampering with unencrypted traffic.\nAn attacker who successfully exploited the OpenSSH vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the product with privileged user permissions. This could cause the product to stop, make the product inaccessible, or the attacker could take control of the product.\nAs part of ABB product lifecycle policy, once a product transitions to Limited state, we discontinue maintenance, security patches, and technical support to focus on current and future technologies. While the product will continue to function, we strongly recommend implementing mitigations defined in this document to mitigate security risks.",

Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n",

Contact your cellular provider for availability.\n\u2022\tMitigate the cellular module vulnerabilities by contacting the mobile network operator and requesting to disable binary SMS for your mobile subscription.\no\tNote that binary SMS service is often disabled by default based on operator restrictions.\no\tIf SMS services are not used in the solution, consider disabling them completely.\n\u2022\tEstablish remote connections through OpenVPN. If the SSH protocol is used for remote administration of Arctic wireless gateway, it is to be considered logging in to the wireless gateway through an OpenVPN tunnel.\n\u2022\tDo not expose SSH port to public networks. Keep the SSH port closed to public networks and thus limit the number of potential attackers who can attempt to exploit the vulnerability. This way only devices within your private network or those connected through a secure VPN can access the SSH server.\n\n\u2022\tRestrict physical access to the product.\n\nRefer to section General security recommendations for further advice on how to keep your system secure.",
