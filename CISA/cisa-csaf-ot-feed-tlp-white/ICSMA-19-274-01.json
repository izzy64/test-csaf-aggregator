The same patches and mitigations apply to VxWorks and the bootrom network stack; however, the bootrom normally uses statically assigned IP-addresses, not DHCP. If that is true, then the defects related to those protocols do not apply in practice. Also, a successful exploit of the bootrom network stack has a more difficult timing component.
