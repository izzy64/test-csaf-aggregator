Users can download Version 5.85 at: (http://www.azeotech.com/downloads.php). For versions older than Version 5.85, disable the DAQFactory networking feature if the system configuration does not require network support. Users can check the “Disable Broadcast” option in the “File - Document Settings” menu.
