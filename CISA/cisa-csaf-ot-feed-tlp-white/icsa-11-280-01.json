This can be done in the Tunnel/Mirror properties of Datahub. If Ports 4502\\TCP and 4503\\TCP are in use, configure authentication on all TCP connections. Instructions for doing this are below: Remove all permissions for the special user names “TCP” and “Mirror” in the security properties of the DataHub. Create a group for users who are authorized, and allow “BasicConnectivity” for that group. The DataHub will then refuse all commands from unauthenticated TCP connections, and still allow authenticated users to connect. (http://www.cogentdatahub.com/Docs/cdh-dhsecurity.html)",
