If Web server functionality is needed, then Rockwell recommends upgrading the product’s firmware to the most current version to have the newest enhanced protections available such as:  When a controller receives two consecutive invalid authentication requests from an HTTP client, the controller resets the Authentication Counter after 60 minutes.  When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Where possible, they suggest you apply multiple recommendations and complement this list with your own best-practices:  Employ layered security and defense-in-depth methods in system design to restrict and control access to individual products and control networks. Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",

When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",

If Web server functionality is needed, then Rockwell recommends upgrading the product’s firmware to the most current version to have the newest enhanced protections available such as:  When a controller receives two consecutive invalid authentication requests from an HTTP client, the controller resets the Authentication Counter after 60 minutes.  When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",

When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",

When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",

When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",

When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",

When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.

Refer to (http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html) for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.",
