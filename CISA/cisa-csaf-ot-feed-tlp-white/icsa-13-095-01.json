This can be done in the Tunnel/Mirror properties of the DataHub. If access to the application from the Internet is not required, block Ports 4502/TCP and 4503/TCP at your firewall, and only allow connections on these ports from within your local area network. If the DataHub Web server is not being used, turn it off in the Web server properties. If access to DataHub from the Internet is not required, block Port 80/TCP at your firewall, and only allow connections on this port from within your local area network. This vulnerability is fixed in the following software versions. Upgrade to one of these applications. DataHub QuickTrend Version 7.3.0. Cogent DataHub Version 7.3.0. OPC DataHub Version 6.4.22. Cascade DataHub for Windows Version 6.4.22.",
