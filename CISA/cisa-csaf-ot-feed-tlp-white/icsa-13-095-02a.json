By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the “Record Data Size” field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the “Total Record Size” that will cause an out-of-bounds read access violation that leads to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.
