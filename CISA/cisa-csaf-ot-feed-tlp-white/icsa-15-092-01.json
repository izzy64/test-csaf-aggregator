Use of User Access Control (UAC) can further improve the security of the computer. To minimize the risk of attack, users who are not directly using this software on a regular basis are strongly encouraged to delete this application from their computer to reduce the likelihood of attack and to store relay configuration files in a protected location. Schneider Electric has updated the VAMPSET tool in order to recognize malformed disturbance recorder files. It now checks the length of the text string in the Comtrade file in order to recognize them as being acceptable. This means that the station name and device identification must be the proper length. If these conditions are not met, the software will block opening the file, remain operational, and report to the user that the file is not complete or contains wrong data.
