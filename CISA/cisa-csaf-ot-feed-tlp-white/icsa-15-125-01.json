Hospira has developed a new version of the PCS Infusion System, Version 7.0 that addresses the identified vulnerabilities. According to Hospira, Version 7.0 has Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET closed by default to prevent unauthorized access. Existing PCA Infusion Systems running Version 5.0 can be upgraded to Version 7.0 when it becomes available. Hospira’s Version 7.0 is being reviewed by the FDA prior to its release. The release date for Version 7.0 of the LifeCare PCA Infusion System has not been determined. For additional information about Hospira’s new release, contact Hospira’s technical support at 1‑800-241-4002. ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.",
