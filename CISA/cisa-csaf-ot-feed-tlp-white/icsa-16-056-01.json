They also recommend the following steps: Do not open untrusted project files with IAB.exe. Upgrade Integrated Architecture Builder V9.6.0.7 and earlier to either V9.7.0.2+ or V9.6.0.8+ (available now) using Current Program Updater. Current Program Updater is a program that is installed on the user’s computer when Integrated Architecture Builder is installed. For additional information, please refer to the user guide which is built into the Current Program Updater application. Run all software as “User,” not as an “Administrator,” to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system. Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments. Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. Use of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar whitelisting applications can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at (https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/546989).",
