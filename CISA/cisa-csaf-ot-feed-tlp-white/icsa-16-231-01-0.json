Power up the LGate and wait 5 minutes. 3. Use the web page on the LGate within the first half hour after power up to verify its firmware version. 3a. If connected to the local network, find the IP assigned to the LGate. Navigate to this IP using the browser on a computer also connected to the same subnet as the LGate. 3b. If the LGate is not connected to the local network, plug the Ethernet cable from the LGate into the computer. Wait until the computer settles into an AutoIP address in the 169.254.X.X range. Then use the IP 169.254.12.13 for the LGate. Use this IP in a browser to pull up the LGate web page. 4. The web page will display the model type, IP address, firmware version of the LGate (labeled as APP), and MAC address. Here is an example. In the picture below, the LGate (00:1E:C0:89:15:6E) is running 1.05C_EM3. 5. Verify that the firmware version is 1.05H_EM3 or above. 6. If the firmware version is less than 1.05H, send an email to (support@locusenergy.com) with the subject line: URGENT FW UPDATE REQUEST: MAC: <insert MAC address here> TO 1.05H or higher FW. 7. Locus Energy support will attempt to remotely update the firmware on the LGate and confirm via email. If they encounter any difficulty in updating the LGate, Locus Energy will contact the user to arrange alternate methods to update or replace the LGate. 8. If support confirms that the unit was updated to Version 1.05H or later, the user may repeat the above procedure (Steps 1-5) to verify this.",
