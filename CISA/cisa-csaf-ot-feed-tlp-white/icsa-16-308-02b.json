Current versions of the Runtime do not require a reboot for the HMI to recover from attack. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. Minimize potential attack surface by leaving the Web Gate Server set to its default disabled state if it is not needed. Place control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. Limit traffic on the local network with managed switches. Where possible, avoid Wi-Fi capabilities",
