Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read data from the heap of the CodeMeter Runtime network server, or crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe).\n\nSiemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.",
