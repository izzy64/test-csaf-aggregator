The vulnerability was found in generated code of the OPC Foundation C-Stack. An unexpected status code in response message will dereference Null pointer leading to crash, ping of death (PoD). This affects a client, but it might also affect a server when it uses OpcUa_ClientApi_RegisterServer (e.g. register at LDS).
