The module is used for\ndiagnostic purposes as well as commissioning and has to be activated\nmanually within the protocol firmwares. For this reason the protocol\nfirmwares are secure by default. Siemens updated the manual to make\nthe situation transparent and raise awareness for operators.\nSiemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not,\nor not yet available.",

The risk of\ncyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized\nby virtue of the grid design.\n\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates\nusing the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made\navailable with the product. If supported by the product, an automated\nmeans to apply the security updates across multiple product instances\nmay be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any\nsecurity update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff\nof the update process in the target environment.\n\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect\nnetwork access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls,\nsegmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment\naccording to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in\na protected IT environment.\n\nRecommended security guidelines can be found at:\n\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity",
