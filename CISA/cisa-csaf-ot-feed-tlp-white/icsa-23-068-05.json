Recommended actions for each affected version are listed in the \u201cRecommended Immediate Actions\u201d section of this document. An attacker who manages to get access with security privileges to the device, can start the update mechanism, supplying a malicious update package to the IED. When the system attempts to verify the tampered update package, a crash occurs resulting in the reboot of the device, after reboot the device is back in normal operation.",

Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to disable the \u201cField Service Tool access\u201d, please follow the referent product Technical Manual.",

After restart the device is back to normal operation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by first gaining access to the system with security privileges, and attempt to update the IED with a malicious update package. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the IED to restart, causing a temporary Denial of Service.",
