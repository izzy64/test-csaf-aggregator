These\nservices were designed on top of the Windows ActiveX and DCOM mechanisms and do not implement state-of-the-art security mechanisms for authentication and encryption of contents.\n\nStarting with WinCC V8.0 the legacy OPC services are no longer enabled by default in new installations. Siemens recommends to use OPC UA instead and to disable the legacy OPC services. For deployments where the legacy OPC services are still in use, ensure that only trusted users are part of the SIMATIC HMI group.",
