Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.",

Currently, no PoC is known to us. To\r\nexploit the heap overflow, additional protection mechanisms need to be broken. Remote access is only possible if CodeMeter is configured as a server. If CodeMeter is not configured as a server, the adversary would need to log in to the machine where the CodeMeter Runtime is running or trick the user into sending a malicious request to CodeMeter.
