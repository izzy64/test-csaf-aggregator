          "details": "Users should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:  Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from public internet or untrusted networks. Ensure application of user management and password features. User rights are enabled by default and forced to create a strong password at first use. Deactivate the Webserver after use, when not needed. Use encrypted communication links. Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to port 80/HTTP and 443/HTTPS. Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required.  The \"Cybersecurity Guidelines for EcoStruxure Machine Expert, Modicon and PacDrive Controllers and Associated Equipment\" provide product specific chapters to ensure you are informed of all updates, including details on affected products and remediation plans.
