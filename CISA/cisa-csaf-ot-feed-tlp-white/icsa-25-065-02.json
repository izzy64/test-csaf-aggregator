Remediation is available for some versions. Recommended actions for each affected version are listed in the Recommended Immediate Actions\nSection.\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability, of which the product does not sufficiently restrict access to internal database tables, could allow anybody with user credentials to bypass security controls that is enforced by the product. Consequently, exploitation may lead to unauthorized modifications on data/firmware, and/or to permanently disabling the product.",

Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. For instance, Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) protocol that is used for device configuration should be limited within the substation only.\nProcess control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.",
