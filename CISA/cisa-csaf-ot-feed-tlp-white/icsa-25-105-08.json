        "text": "Mitigating factors describe conditions and circumstances that make an attack that exploits the vulnerability difficult or less likely to succeed. The following mitigations are recommended.\n1.\tObtain a cellular private access point (APN). A dedicated private cellular access point and respective SIM card subscriptions can be requested from your cellular service provider. This service doesn\u2019t expose the traffic between remote sites and main site to the internet but rather uses cellular operator\u2019s private wide area network (WAN). Therefore, the ARM600 wouldn\u2019t need open ports to the internet.\n2.\tAvoid exposing any system component to the internet. If, however, the ARM600 is exposed to the internet, only the VPN port should be opened towards the internet (e.g., Patrol management connections can be configured to use VPN tunnel and remote administration connections can be implemented by using OpenVPN PC-client).\n3.\tARM600 system is by default not dependent on the name service (DNS). If name service is not used in the system, the name service port (TCP/UDP port 53) can be blocked by a firewall.\n4.\tPerform firewall configuration by the \"allowlisting\" principle, i.e., explicitly allowing only the required ports and protocols and blocking any other traffic.\n5.\tFilter specific ICMP packets from external systems (ICMP type 13 and 14) by firewall for not exposing the system time. \n6.\tIf the internet is used as a WAN media for carrying VPN tunnels, use Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) for terminating connections from the internet (i.e., the remote connections should terminate to the DMZ network, which would be segregated from other networks by a firewall. The ARM600 server would be located into this DMZ).\n\n7.\tChange the default user credentials of ARM600 and Arctic wireless gateways into non-defaults and use complex non-guessable passwords with special characters. Do not reuse passwords within the system.\n\n\n8.\tUse administrator (i.e., root user) privileges only when required by the task.\n\n\n9.\tSupporting systems, such as PCs used for configuration, should be frequently updated. If possible, use dedicated site PCs for upgrading and engineering purposes. At minimum, PCs should be investigated by running a full virus scan with recently updated signature files before introducing the PC to the OT system. \n\nAny data, such as device configurations and firmware update files transferred to the Arctic system should be virus scanned prior to transferring.\n\n\n10.\tIntroduce a backup policy, which will ensure periodical backups and backup revision numbering. Consider the following:\na.\tCheck that the entire system has backups available from all applicable parts.\nb.\tStore the backups in a safe place (e.g. in an encrypted storage), restricted by role-based access control mechanisms.\nc.\tEnsure the security of the configuration PCs that may have local copies of device configurations.\nd.\tValidate the backups to make sure that they\u2019re working.\n\n\n11.\tFollow cyber security best practices for installation, operation, and decommissioning as described in the product\u2019s Cyber Security Deployment Guideline and User Manual.\n\n\n12.\tUse continuous monitoring (e.g., intrusion detection/prevention tools) to detect anomalies in the system\n\n\n13.\tConsider hardening the system according to the following:\na.\tRemove any unnecessary communication links in the system.\nb.\tIf possible, close unused physical ports.\nc.\tOpen only the necessary TCP/UDP ports in the configuration.\nd.\tRemove all unnecessary user accounts.\ne.\tRestrict traffic by firewall.\nf.\tAllow the traffic only from/to necessary hosts' IP addresses (i.e., define both source and destination in the firewall rules, where possible).\ng.\tDefine client IP address as allowed address in SCADA communication protocols, if such configuration is supported.\nh.\tRemove or deactivate all unused processes, communication ports and services, where possible.\ni.\tUse physical access controls to the system installations (e.g., to server rooms and device cabinets). \n\n\n14.\tIn ARM600SW installations, avoid servers with AMD processors vulnerable to the following: CVE-2021-26401, CVE-2023-20569 and CVE-2023-20593.\n\n\n15.\tAvoid using AX88179_178A chipset-based USB -to-Ethernet devices.\n\n\nRefer to section General security recommendations for additional advice on how to keep your system secure.\n",

Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\nMore information on recommended practices can be found in the following document:\n1MRS758860 Rev.
