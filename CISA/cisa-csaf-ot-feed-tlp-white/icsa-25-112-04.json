CODESYS Runtime System v.3.5.15.0 is utilized in the firmware of ABB MV ACS6080 and ACS5000 drives to provide IEC 61131 programming capabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could lead to out-of-bound memory access. A successful exploit may result in a denial-of-service condition or arbitrary code execution. \nFirmware updates are available to address the vulnerabilities in products listed as affected in this advisory.\n",

        "text": "To exploit these vulnerabilities, a successful login to the affected product is required. This can be achieved by one of the following methods:\n\n\u2022\tConnecting a computer to the Drive, that is running Drive Automation Builder (Automation Builder | ABB) or Drive Composer (Drive Composer - Software tools | ABB).\n\n\n\u2022\tHaving access to the local network where the drive is located. In this case, an attacker could send mal-formed packets directly to the drive.\n\n\nTo make the attack more difficult and less likely to succeed, provide network isolation where the drive is located and ensure that no computer running Drive Automation Builder or Drive Composer is connected to the drive without proper security controls. Please refer to \u201cGeneral security recommendations\u201d for further advise on how to keep drive secure. \nRefer to the \u201cGeneral Security Recommendations\u201d section at the end of this document for further mitigation actions.\n",

Please refer to \u201cImpact of workaround\u201d section to understand possible reduced functionality of the drive.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Contact a qualified and certified ABB personnel if you need more information about the parameter handling of the affected products.\n\nImpact of workaround\n\nThis workaround restricts the updating of IEC programs, but existing IEC programs on Drives can still be used. To update an IEC program, the operator must unlock the user lock and enable file download in a protected network environment. It is highly recommended to disable file download, as vulnerabilities are more easily exploitable when file download is enabled.\nWARNING: The user lock cannot be opened even by ABB if the pass code is lost.\n",

        "text": "For any installation of software-related ABB products we strongly recommend the following (non-exhaustive) list of cyber security practices:\n\u2022\tIsolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls and separate them from any general-purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).\n\u2022\tInstall physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\n\u2022\tNever connect programming software or computers containing programing software to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.\n\u2022\tScan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.\n\u2022\tMinimize network exposure for all applications and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet unless they are designed for such exposure and the intended use requires such.\n\u2022\tEnsure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system, and firmware patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.\n\u2022\tWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\u2022\tInstall the drive in a secure location that is only accessible to authorized persons.\n\u2022\tInstall physical controls so only authorized personnel can access devices connected to the drive (computers, peripheral equipment, and networks).\n\u2022\tAvoid connecting computers containing Drive Automation Builder programing software to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended for. \n\u2022\tEnsure security controls are followed on computers connected to the Drive. For example, updated security patches, firewall, anti-virus are installed, and only authorized Software is running. It is customer responsibility to ensure these conditions.\nMore information on recommended practices can be found in the reference section document:  Protecting operations through cyber security: ABB Drives solutions.\n",

Open the user lock via the \"96.02 Pass code\" parameter and make sure that bit 9 \"Enable online IEC programming\" is set to TRUE in the \"96.102 User lock functionality\" parameter.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: After this task, be sure to disable CODESYS communication by setting the bit back to FALSE.\nA future firmware update is planned to update the CODESYS RTS library, which will further strengthen defenses for the vulnerabilities mentioned above.\n\n\nFor situations where firmware update is not feasible, please refer to \u201cWorkarounds\u201d section.",
