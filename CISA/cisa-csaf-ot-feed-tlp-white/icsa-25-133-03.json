Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password\npolicies and processes should be followed.\nFor detailed mitigation strategies, customers can approach their Hitachi Energy organization contact.\nIt is highly recommended to deploy the product following the \u201cMACH GWS cybersecurity deployment guideline\u201d\ndocument.
