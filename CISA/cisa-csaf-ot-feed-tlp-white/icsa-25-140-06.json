Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/ document.
