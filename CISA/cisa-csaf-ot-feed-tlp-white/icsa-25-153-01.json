If your router supports a guest network or VLAN, it is preferable to locate the device there.\n* Use the strongest Wi-Fi encryption available, such as WPA3 or WPA2/3 with protected management frames.\n* Schedule regular reboots of your routing device, smartphones, and computers.\n* Ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain physical access to your devices (USB or LAN ports should be easily accessible.\n\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/ document.",
