If your router supports a guest network or VLAN, it is preferable to locate the device there.\n* Use the strongest Wi-Fi encryption available, such as WPA3 or WPA2/3 with protected management frames.\n* Schedule regular reboots of your routing device, smartphones, and computers.\n\n For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/ document.",
