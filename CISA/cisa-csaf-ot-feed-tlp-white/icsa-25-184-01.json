        "text": "Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.\nIt is highly recommended to deploy the product following the \u201cRelion 670 series Version 2.2 IEC Cybersecurity deployment guideline\u201d document. To mitigate the risk, the FTP service can be disabled over identified access points using Ethernet Configuration Tool (ECT) in PCM600. For other series and versions, disabling the FTP service over unwanted network segments can be achieved using the firewall access control.\nIn the latest fixed versions of IEDs, disk writing is denied for the large and unknown random files. IED memory management has been improved, and an alert will be issued to user when the disk space upper threshold has been reached.",
