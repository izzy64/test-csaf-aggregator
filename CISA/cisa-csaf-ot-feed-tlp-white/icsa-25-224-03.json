Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric [Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices](https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/) document.",

EcoStruxure Power Monitoring Expert (PME) is an on-premises software used to help power critical and energy-intensive facilities maximize uptime and operational efficiency. Note: There are some instances of PME being deployed in a Managed Service model. EcoStruxure Power Operation (EPO) and EcoStruxure Power SCADA Operation (PSO) are on-premises software offers that provides a single platform to monitor and control medium and lower power systems. Failure to apply the remediation and/or mitigations provided below may risk deserialization of untrusted data,server-side request forgery and/or path traversal that could result in remote code execution, and/or unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
