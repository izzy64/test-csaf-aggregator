Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document. \n",

CVSS v3.1 will be still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer's environment."
