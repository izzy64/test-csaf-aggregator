        "text": "MSM is not intrinsically designed and intended to be directly connected to the internet. Please disconnect the device from any internet facing network, if any installation has performed the same. Suggest adopting user access management and any state-of-the-art antivirus protection engines equipped with the latest signature rules on the computers that have installed and operating the MSM Client application. As an example, please use the Operating System (OS) inbuilt user access management functionality, if supported, to limit the probability of unauthorized access followed by rogue commands via MSM Client application. Also, recommend following the hardening guidelines published by \u201cThe Center for Internet Security (CIS)\u201d https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/ to protect the host Operating System of computers that connects with MSM. This measure would then prevent the lateral movement of the attack vector into MSM via these connected devices. Some examples for Windows based computers are listed below. 1) CIS Microsoft Windows Desktop Benchmarks (cisecurity.org) 2) CIS Microsoft Windows Server Benchmarks (cisecurity.org) Please also follow the cybersecurity deployment recommendations as document inside section 3.9 of 2GHV045871_2018-P-en-Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) - C. Additionally, recommend hardening web browsers in accordance with CIS Critical Security Control 9: Email and Web Browser Protections. Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.",
