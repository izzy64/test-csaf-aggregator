This could allow an attacker to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack that modifies parameters, making the network connection fail. Alternatively, an attacker could spoof the server host and send specifically crafted data. CVE-2022-26394 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L).",
