        "text": "CODESYS group published several vulnerabilities regarding the CODESYS Runtime System, which is included in the firmware of ABB LV DC drives and power controllers. It is used to implement a selection of features and to provide IEC 611131-3 programming capabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities include memory corruption issues that could lead to out-of-bound memory access. Subsequently, a successful exploit could allow attackers to trigger a denial-of-service condition or execute arbitrary code over the fieldbus interfaces.   Exploiting these vulnerabilities requires an IEC 61131-3 license being present on the memory unit of the drive or power controller. \n",

If none of these are connected exploitation is not possible. For network based attacks the attacker needs to be able to reach the drive or power controller via the network.\n",

Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.",

        "text": "ABB has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they can help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, this is identified below as Impact of workaround.\n\nActivate User Lock and disable file upload\n\nTo mitigate the exploitability of the vulnerabilities ABB recommends disabling the upload of firmware, including IEC 61131-3 programs to the drive or power controller. Additionally, it is recommended to close the User Lock and enable the Parameter Lock, so an attacker is not able to unblock the firmware upload over fieldbus.\nThe settings can be applied via the Drive Composer tool. For the user lock to be effective and the parameter lock bound to the user lock, the following steps need to be performed:\nDCS880\n\n\u2022\tEnter the default user pass code 10000000 in 96.07 Pass code\n\u2022\tChange the default user pass code to a random number using 96.100 Change user pass code and 96.101 Confirm user pass code\n\u2022\tIn 96.102 User lock functionality set bits 0, 2, 3 and 6 to 1 (high)\n\u2022\tBit 0: Disable ABB access levels\n\u2022\tBit 2: Disable file download\n\u2022\tBit 3: Disable Fieldbus write to hidden parameters\n\u2022\tBit 6: Protect AP\n\u2022\tEnter any invalid pass code in 96.07 Pass code to close the lock\n\u2022\tTo enable the parameter lock set 96.07 Pass code = 358\n\u2022\tIn 96.04 Access Levels Active Bit 14 (parameter lock) is set\n\u2022\tEnter your user pass code in 96.07 Pass code to open the lock\n\u2022\tIn 96.102 User lock functionality set bit 1 to 1 (high) to freeze the parameter lock state\n\u2022\tEnter any invalid pass code in 96.07 Pass code to close the lock\n\nDCT880\n\n\u2022\tEnter the default user pass code 10000000 in 96.02 Pass code\n\u2022\tChange the default user pass code to a random number using 96.100 Change user pass code and 96.101 Confirm user pass code\n\u2022\tIn 96.102 User lock functionality set bits 0, 2, 3 and 6 to 1 (high)\n\u2022\tBit 0: Disable ABB access levels\n\u2022\tBit 2: Disable file download\n\u2022\tBit 3: Disable Fieldbus write to hidden parameters\n\u2022\tBit 6: Protect AP\n\u2022\tEnter any invalid pass code in 96.02 Pass code to close the lock\n\u2022\tTo enable the parameter lock set 96.02 Pass code = 358\n\u2022\tIn 96.03 Access Levels Active Bit 14 (parameter lock) is set\n\u2022\tEnter your user pass code in 96.02 Pass code to open the lock\n\u2022\tIn 96.102 User lock functionality set bit 1 to 1 (high) to freeze the parameter lock state\n\u2022\tEnter any invalid pass code in 96.02 Pass code to close the lock\n\nVerification\n\nPlease be aware: If those steps are not performed in the correct order, the pass code might be circum-vented. Setting the correct User Lock Functionality bits is not enough to secure the device. Please make sure the lock is closed (parameters 96.100 to 96.102 not visible).\nIf the User Lock is open, warning 1236 is set.\n\nImpact of the workaround\n\nAfter applying the workaround, the IEC 61131-3 programs can be used, but not uploaded to the drive anymore. To upload an IEC program the operator has to unlock the User Lock and disable the File Up-load Lock.\nIf the parameter lock is applied no parameter of the drive can be changed. To change the parameter the operator has to unlock the User Lock and disable the parameter lock.\nThe disablement of the file downloads includes\n\u2022\tFirmware uploads\n\u2022\tSafety functions module FSO-21 configuration\n\u2022\tParameter restore to default values. See parameter 96.15 for details.\n\u2022\tLoading of adaptive programs\n\u2022\tLoading and debugging application programs via Drive application builder\n\u2022\tChanging the home view of the control panel\n\u2022\tEditing drive texts\n\u2022\tEditing the favorite parameters list on the control panel\n\u2022\tConfiguration settings done via control panel (time, date, etc.)\nIt is strongly recommended to only unlock the User Lock in a maintenance scenario, not during normal operation. Enabling upload of files and therefore an update of firmware during operation could lead to undesired behavior. As long as the User Lock is open the vulnerabilities are exploitable.\n",
