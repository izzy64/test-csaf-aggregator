        "text": "Festo Didactic offers products with security functions that aid the safe operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks from cyber threats, a comprehensive security concept must be implemented and continuously updated. Festo products and services only constitute one part of such a concept.\nThe customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Systems, machines and components should only be connected to a company's network or the Internet if and as necessary, and only when the suitable security measures (e.g., firewalls and network segmentation, defense-in-depth) are in place. Failure to ensure adequate security measures when connecting the product to the network can result in vulnerabilities which allow unauthorized, remote access to the network - even beyond the product boundaries. This access could be abused to incur a loss of data or manipulate or sabotage systems. Typical forms of attack include but are not limited to: Denial-of-Service (rendering the system temporarily non-functional), remote execution of malicious code, privilege escalation (executing malicious code with higher system privileges than expected), ransomware (encryption of data and demanding payment for decryption). In the context of industrial systems and machines this can also lead to unsafe states, posing a danger to people and equipment.\nFurthermore, Festo guidelines on suitable security measures should be observed. Festo products and solutions are constantly being developed further in order to make them more secure. Festo strongly recommends that customers install product updates as soon as they become available and always use the latest versions of its products. Any use of product versions that are no longer supported or any failure to install the latest updates may render the customer vulnerable to cyber-attacks.",
