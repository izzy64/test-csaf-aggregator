The key is used for the legacy protection of confidential configuration data and the legacy PG/PC and HMI communication.\n\nThis could allow attackers to discover the private key of a CPU product family by an offline attack against a single CPU of the family. Attackers could then use this knowledge to extract confidential configuration data from projects that are protected by that key or to perform attacks against legacy PG/PC and HMI communication.\nSiemens recommends to update both the affected products as well as the corresponding TIA Portal project to the latest versions. TIA Portal V17 and related CPU firmware versions introduced protection of confidential configuration data based on individual passwords per device and TLS-protected PG/PC and HMI communication.\n\nAdditional details can be found in the related Siemens security bulletin SSB-898115 (\nhttps://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssb-898115.html).",
