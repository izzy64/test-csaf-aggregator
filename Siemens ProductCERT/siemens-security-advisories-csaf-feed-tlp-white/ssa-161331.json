If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution or data extraction on the target host system.\n\nSiemens has released an update for Simcenter STAR-CCM+ Viewer and recommends to update to the latest version to fix the vulnerability. Siemens recommends to avoid opening of untrusted files from unknown sources."
