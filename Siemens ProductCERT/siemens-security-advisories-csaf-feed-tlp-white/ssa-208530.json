If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected application, this could lead to an access violation, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution on the target host system.\n\nSiemens has released updates for NX and recommends to update to the latest version to fix the vulnerabilities. Siemens recommends to avoid opening of untrusted files from unknown sources."
