Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to alter and forge a license file, cause a denial-of-service condition, attain remote code execution, or prevent normal operation of the Siemens software that depends on CodeMeter Runtime.\n\nSiemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available."
