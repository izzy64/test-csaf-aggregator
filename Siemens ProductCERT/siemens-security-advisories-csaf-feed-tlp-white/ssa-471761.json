        "text": "SICAM T before V3.0 contain multiple vulnerabilities. These include critical issues such as improper parameter and input validation, various Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities , and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability . Additional weaknesses comprise session fixation, authentication and authorization bypasses , missing HTTPS protection, and missing cookie protection flags. These issues could potentially lead to remote code execution, denial of service, unauthorized access to web-interface functionality, session hijacking, impersonation of legitimate users, or allow an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the device on behalf of a user.\n\nSiemens has released a new version for SICAM T and recommends to update to the latest version.",

        "text": "Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. \nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\n\nRecommended security guidelines can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity",
