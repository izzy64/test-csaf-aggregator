        "text": "On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging library used in many Java-based applications) was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as \"Log4Shell\".\n\nOn 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering the initial mitigations and fix in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default configurations. Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to fix both vulnerabilities.\n\nOn 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassified with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0). The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.\n\nSiemens Energy is preparing updates and recommends specific countermeasures for SPPA-T3000.",

        "text": "Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.\n\nSiemens Energy strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens Energy strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.\n\nAs a general security measure Siemens Energy strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.",
