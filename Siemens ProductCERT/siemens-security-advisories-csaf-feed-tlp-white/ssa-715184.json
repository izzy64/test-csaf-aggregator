If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution or data extraction on the target host system.\n\nSiemens recommends to update to the latest version and to avoid opening of untrusted files from unknown sources. Please refer to SSA-574442 for further information regarding latest version update."
