If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected application, this could lead to an access violation, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution on the target host system.\n\nSiemens has released an update for the NX 1980 Series and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens recommends to avoid opening of untrusted files from unknown sources."
